## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Creating the Revive Church web app was an exciting and fulfilling experience. I designed and developed the app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on delivering a clean, user-friendly interface that reflects the values and energy of the church.

The process began with crafting the structure of the site using HTML, ensuring all the essential sections such as the homepage, events, sermons, and contact pages were logically organized and easy to navigate. I used CSS to bring the design to life—selecting color schemes, fonts, and layouts that evoke a welcoming atmosphere while maintaining a modern and professional look. Animations and hover effects were added to give the site an interactive and polished feel.

JavaScript was where the real fun began! I incorporated dynamic elements like an interactive events calendar and a smooth, responsive navigation menu to enhance the user experience. It was incredibly rewarding to see the pieces come together, especially as I implemented form validations and real-time updates, making the site engaging and functional for visitors.

The entire process was a blast—from problem-solving to experimenting with new techniques. Building this app not only gave me the chance to improve my web development skills but also allowed me to create something meaningful for the community.

## Lessons Learned:

One key thing I learned while building the Revive Church web app is how to balance functionality with performance. As I worked on optimizing the site for speed and responsiveness, I discovered how important it is to carefully manage assets like images, scripts, and CSS to ensure the app runs smoothly without sacrificing design or interactivity. This experience deepened my understanding of best practices like lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient use of modern web technologies.
